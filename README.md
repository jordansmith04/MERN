NASA's Exoplanet Tracker is an application that allows the user to view facts about the most recent exoplanet discoveries, look at Nasa's picture of the day for any day, and obtain inspirational quotes. NASA's Free APIs for Picture of the Day and Exoplanet information were used. As well as an inspirational quote API provided by Freecodecamp. Created in order to practice using React with external APIs.
